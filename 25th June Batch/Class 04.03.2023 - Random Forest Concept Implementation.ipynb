    "#### Ensemble Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of learning takes into consideration different algorithms and different set of training data to build the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  In here our model creates multiple models , as an example suppose one individual is planning to buy a car , and the person has a specific choice of car. Suppose that model is \"Honda City\"\n",
    "2.  Now the individual will go and ask for feedbacks for that particular car from multiple people.\n",
    "3.  Some will say yes to Honda City , some will say no to Honday city , so multiple decisions will come into picture.\n",
    "4.  Our model will iterate through this all this decision and based on precision , accuracy etc , it will get us the best possible decision.\n",
    "5.  Now to look into this in machine learning perspective , the multiple people who are being asked about the decision can use multiple algorithms , as some can use KNN , some can use logistic regression , some can use SVM etc etc , this is one kind of ensemble learning.\n",
    "6.  Another pattern would be using the same algorithm , suppose Logistic regression but using different training data set from the main master data set to conclude with a final result.\n",
    "7.  This different models using different algorithms are called learners."

    "There is one final step of data preparation: splitting data into training and testing sets. During training, we let the model ‘see’ the answers, in this case the actual temperature, so it can learn how to predict the temperature from the features. We expect there to be some relationship between all the features and the target value, and the model’s job is to learn this relationship during training. Then, when it comes time to evaluate the model, we ask it to make predictions on a testing set where it only has access to the features (not the answers)! Because we do have the actual answers for the test set, we can compare these predictions to the true value to judge how accurate the model is. Generally, when training a model, we randomly split the data into training and testing sets to get a representation of all data points (if we trained on the first nine months of the year and then used the final three months for prediction, our algorithm would not perform well because it has not seen any data from those last three months.) I am setting the random state to 42 which means the results will be the same each time I run the split for reproducible results."
