        "# Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don’t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x=\"I'm a string\" without error\n",
        "# Python is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++’s public, private).\n",
        "# In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects\n",
        "# Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately，Python allows the inclusion of C-based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. \n",
        "# The numpy package is a good example of this, it’s really quite quick because a lot of the number-crunching it does isn’t actually done by Python\n",
        "# Python finds use in many spheres – web applications, automation, scientific modeling, big data applications and many more. \n",
        "# It’s also often used as “glue” code to get other languages and components to play nice. Learn more about Big Data and its applications from the Data Engineering Training."
